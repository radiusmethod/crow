## [Unreleased]

Backfill of merged PRs since the 0.1.0 release, grouped by theme.

### Automation

- #137 — Session analytics emitted via Claude Code's OpenTelemetry exporter (configure via `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`).
- #163 / #165 — Add `remoteControlEnabled` setting; new sessions launch with `--rc` so they can be driven from claude.ai or the mobile app. The `/crow-workspace` skill honors the setting.
- #182 — Auto-complete now requires positive evidence that the session was worked before flipping to Completed; prevents idle sessions being marked done by an unrelated PR merge.
- #189 — Manager terminal launches in `--permission-mode auto` by default so orchestration commands (`crow`, `gh`, `git`) skip per-call approval. Toggle at Settings → Automation → Manager Terminal.
- #209 — Per-workspace opt-in to auto-start review sessions when a PR becomes reviewable.
- #211 — Auto-create a workspace when an issue assigned to you carries the `crow:auto` label.
- #213 — Auto-suggest opening a PR when a session completes its work but no PR is linked yet.
- #214 — Optional auto-respond toggles: when enabled, Crow types an instruction into the session's Claude Code terminal in response to changes-requested reviews and failed CI checks. Off by default.
- #222 — PRs opened from a Crow session are auto-labeled `crow:auto`.
- #228 — Settings split into discrete tabs; every automation toggle lives under Settings → Automation. New `docs/automation.md` covers the full lifecycle.

### Review Board & Sessions

- #153 — Fix PR review status not reflecting the actual review state.
- #174 — Ticket card issue and PR chips are now clickable.
- #188 — "Move to Active" button on completed sessions returns them to active without deletion.
- #205 — PR link reconciliation for sessions that missed reactive detection — `gh pr list` is consulted on the next polling cycle.
- #206 — Rename terminals via the UI and via `crow rename-terminal`.
- #207 — `defaults.excludeReviewRepos` filters repos from the review board, badge counts, and notifications. Wildcards supported.
- #210 — Bulk delete for sessions in the sidebar.
- #212 — Multi-select + batch Start Review on the review board.
- #220 — Filtering for the tickets list.
- #226 — Per-section select all and icon-only cancel button in selection mode.
- #231 — Quick action buttons on the session detail header.

### Terminal Runtime

- #159 — Fix diagonal window resize and content-driven window growth.
- #161 — Fix batch "Work on" sending a malformed `/crow-batch-workspace` line.
- #218 — Recover from failed Ghostty surface creation by retrying.
- #229 — New tmux backend behind the `CROW_TMUX_BACKEND` feature flag (or Settings → Experimental). Off by default; opt in for a headless-PTY runtime that decouples terminal lifecycle from view rendering.

### GitLab

- #215 — Fix GitLab fetch failing when `GITLAB_HOST` did not match the workspace host; reconcile now silently skips GitLab candidates whose host can't be determined.
- #233 — Fix `glab` fetch failures from a non-repo cwd and slug truncation on nested groups (`big-bang/product/packages/elasticsearch-kibana` is no longer truncated to `big-bang/product`).

### Tooling & Misc

- #152 — Replace dock icon with the Corveil Brandmark.
- #155 — Docs refresh: README, `make build` promotion, GitHub project scope wording.
- #162 — Silence noisy console logs from Ghostty and IssueTracker.
- #172 — Log `gh` stderr on IssueTracker shell failures.
- #175 — Consolidate IssueTracker `gh` calls into a single GraphQL query.
- #176 — Open-source readiness: license, code of conduct, CI, doc cleanup.
- #178 — CI warms the Ghostty cache on `main` so PRs share it.
- #180 — Fix IssueTracker duplicate-key crash on PR status refresh.
- #185 — Replace the Corveil Brandmark PNG with an SVG for crisper rendering.
- #208 — Ignore subagent hook events fired after a turn's `Stop` so the sidebar dot doesn't get stuck "working".
- #234 — `crow hook-event` is a silent no-op when the Crow app is not running, so non-Crow `claude` sessions don't log noise.

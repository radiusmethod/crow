# Crow

A native macOS application for managing AI-powered development sessions. Orchestrates git worktrees, Claude Code instances, and GitHub/GitLab issue tracking in a unified interface with an embedded Ghostty terminal.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/radiusmethod/crow.git
cd crow

# 2. Install the Metal Toolchain (required to compile Ghostty's Metal shaders)
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain

# 3. Build (submodules + GhosttyKit + swift build in one shot)
make build

# 4. Authenticate GitHub CLI — the write `project` scope is required
gh auth login
gh auth refresh -s project,read:org,repo

# 5. Run
.build/debug/CrowApp
```

On first launch, a setup wizard guides you through choosing your development root directory and configuring workspaces. Alternatively, configure via the CLI without launching the GUI:

```bash
.build/debug/crow setup
```

> **Note:** The required GitHub scope is the **write** `project` scope — `read:project` is insufficient because Crow updates ticket status via the `updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue` GraphQL mutation. See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md#3-github-authentication) for details.

### Install (put `crow` on your PATH)

The Manager terminal and the `/crow-workspace` skill call bare `crow ...`, so a fresh build that you can only launch by full path will break those workflows. Install the binaries so they're invokable from anywhere:

```bash
make install                       # symlinks crow + CrowApp into ~/.local/bin
```

If `~/.local/bin` isn't already on your `PATH`, add this to `~/.zshrc` (then restart your shell):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Use a different directory with `BINDIR`, e.g. `make install BINDIR=/usr/local/bin`.

`make install` creates **symlinks** into `.build/debug/`, so a later `make build` updates them in place — no need to re-run it. Re-run `make install` only when you switch to a release build (`make release && make install CONFIG=release`) or after `make clean` (which removes `.build/` and leaves the symlinks dangling until the next build). Remove the symlinks with `make uninstall`.

**GUI install:** for a `.app` bundle in `/Applications` (launchable from Spotlight/Dock), run `make release && make install-app`. See [Releases](#releases) if macOS quarantines the unsigned bundle.

## Usage

### The Sidebar

- **Tickets** — Assigned issues grouped by project board status (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done in last 24h). Click a status to filter.
- **Manager** — A persistent Claude Code terminal for orchestrating work. Use `/crow-workspace` here to create new sessions. Launches in `--permission-mode auto` by default so orchestration commands (`crow`, `gh`, `git`) run without per-call approval; opt out via Settings → Automation → Manager Terminal.
- **Active Sessions** — One per work context. Shows repo, branch, issue/PR badges with pipeline and review status.
- **Completed Sessions** — Sessions whose PRs have been merged or issues closed.

### Creating a Session

In the Manager tab, tell Claude Code what you want to work on:

```
/crow-workspace https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123
```

Or use natural language:

```
/crow-workspace "add authentication to the acme-api API"
```

This will:

1. Create a git worktree with a feature branch
2. Create a session with ticket metadata
3. Launch Claude Code in plan mode with the issue context
4. Auto-assign the issue and set its project status to "In Progress"

## Features

### Ticket Board

- Pipeline view showing issues by project board status
- Click a status to filter the list
- "Start Working" button creates a workspace directly from an issue
- Issues linked to active sessions show a navigation button

### PR Status Tracking

- Pipeline checks (passing/failing/pending)
- Review status (approved/changes requested/needs review)
- Merge readiness (mergeable/conflicting/merged)
- Purple badge with checkmark for merged PRs

### Auto-Complete

- Sessions automatically move to "Completed" when their linked PR is merged or issue is closed
- Checked every 60 seconds during the issue polling cycle
- Requires positive evidence the session was worked, so an unrelated PR merge can't flip an idle session

### Automation Suite

Crow can drive a ticket from assignment to merged with minimal manual steps. Toggles live under **Settings → Automation**; full walkthrough in [docs/automation.md](docs/automation.md).

- **Auto-create workspace** when an issue assigned to you is labeled `crow:auto`
- **Auto-label PRs** opened from a Crow session with `crow:auto`
- **Auto-suggest opening a PR** if a session completes with no PR linked
- **Auto-start review sessions** for opted-in workspaces when a PR becomes reviewable
- **Auto-respond** to changes-requested reviews and failed CI checks (off by default)
- **Auto-merge** Crow-authored PRs labeled `crow:merge` via `gh pr merge --auto --squash` (off by default; only acts on PRs whose commits carry a `Crow-Session:` trailer matching a known session). Crow lazily creates the `crow:merge` label on first observation; to pre-seed it manually: `gh label create crow:merge --color 0E8A16 --description "Crow: enable auto-merge once mergeable"`

### Review Board

- Multi-select with batch Start Review
- Bulk delete sessions
- Filter projects out via `excludeReviewRepos`
- Quick action buttons on the session detail header (open PR, mark in review, copy branch)
- Move completed sessions back to active

### Terminals

- Rename tabs from the UI or via `crow rename-terminal`
- GPU-accelerated rendering via Ghostty
- tmux-backed managed terminals by default — one shared Ghostty surface attached to a tmux session, so per-session shells stay alive across UI navigation. Requires `tmux ≥ 3.3` (`brew install tmux`). Set `CROW_TMUX_BACKEND=0` for a launch to fall back to the legacy per-terminal Ghostty backend (escape hatch; will be removed in a follow-up release). See [docs/architecture.md#terminal-backends](docs/architecture.md#terminal-backends).

### Orphan Recovery

- On startup, scans git worktrees across all repos
- Worktrees not tracked in the store are automatically recovered as sessions
- Fetches ticket metadata and PR links from GitHub for recovered sessions

### Safe Deletion

- Deleting a session on a protected branch (main, master, develop) only removes the session metadata — the repo folder and branch are preserved
- The delete confirmation dialog reflects this, showing "Remove Session" instead of "Delete Everything"

## Development

### Adding a New Package

1. Create the package under `Packages/`
2. Add it to the root `Package.swift` dependencies and target
3. Import in the targets that need it

### Testing

```bash
make test     # or: swift test, or: mise test
```

Tests use the [Swift Testing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/) framework (`@Test` macros). Test files live under `Packages/*/Tests/`.

We welcome contributions! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on reporting bugs, suggesting features, and submitting pull requests.

## Releases

Official releases are signed and notarized via GitHub Actions. Download the latest DMG from the [Releases](https://github.com/radiusmethod/crow/releases) page — it will install without Gatekeeper warnings.

**Building from source:** Code signing is only required for distribution. Developers building from source do not need a signing certificate — `make build` and `make release` produce unsigned but fully functional builds. If macOS quarantines an unsigned `.app`, remove it with:

```bash
xattr -cr Crow.app
```

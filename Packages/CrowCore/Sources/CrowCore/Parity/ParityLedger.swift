/// The checked-in CLI control-plane parity ledger (CROW-807, ADR 0016).
///
/// Crow's control plane exists three times over: the JSON-RPC methods `crowd`
/// registers, the `crow` verbs that call them, and the ``AppConfig`` fields both
/// mutate. Nothing in the compiler ties those together, so a capability can ship
/// as an RPC method plus a web control and quietly never grow a CLI path. This
/// ledger is the one place that states, per method and per config field, whether
/// a CLI path exists — and when it doesn't, *why*.
///
/// **It is not documentation; it is a gate.** Three checks keep it honest:
///
/// - `CrowCLITests/ParityGateTests` — every ``Coverage/cli(_:)`` path resolves
///   against `CrowCommand`'s subcommand tree, and ``configFields`` matches the
///   `Mirror` walk of `AppConfig` exactly, in both directions.
/// - `CrowDaemonTests/RPCLedgerParityTests` — ``rpcMethods`` matches
///   `CommandRouter.methodNames` for the live daemon+engine router pair.
/// - `scripts/check-cli-parity.sh` — the same RPC assertion by text, because
///   CrowDaemon is Darwin-only and cannot run in the Linux PR lane.
///
/// Adding a ``Coverage/noCLI(reason:)`` row is the review gate: the reason is a
/// required associated value, so an exemption cannot be added silently. Each
/// per-area parity ticket closes its gap by *deleting* rows from the exempt set.
///
/// ``Coverage/noCLI(reason:)`` is CROW-807's `KNOWN_UI_ONLY` allowlist, named for
/// what it asserts rather than what usually causes it — most exemptions are indeed
/// web-UI-only, but a few surfaces (the web-password hash) are readable nowhere.

# Crow Review PR

Perform a comprehensive code and security review on a GitHub pull request, then post the findings as a PR review.

## Important: Sandbox Bypass

All `gh` and `git` commands require `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` because they need network/TLS access.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - The PR URL or number to review (required)

## Activation

This skill activates when:
- User invokes `/crow-review-pr` command
- User asks to "review a PR" or "review this pull request"
- This is a review session (the session was created via the Crow Reviews board)

## Instructions

You are performing a code and security review on PR $ARGUMENTS. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Checkout the PR

```bash
gh pr checkout $ARGUMENTS
```

### Step 2: Gather PR Information

Get the PR details including title, description, and changed files:

```bash
gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,additions,deletions,changedFiles,files
```

### Step 3: Review the Code

Read all changed files in the PR. For each file, analyze:

**Security Review:**
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Input validation vulnerabilities
- Injection risks (SQL, command, XSS)
- Secrets/credentials exposure
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Insecure configurations
- OWASP Top 10 concerns

**Code Quality:**
- Logic errors
- Error handling
- Resource leaks
- Race conditions
- API design issues
- Missing tests for new code

### Step 4: Run Static Analysis

For Go projects:
```bash
cd core && go vet ./... 2>&1
cd core && go test ./... -v 2>&1 | head -50
```

For JavaScript/TypeScript projects:
```bash
npm run lint 2>&1 | head -50
```

For Swift projects:
```bash
swift build 2>&1 | tail -20
```

For Python projects:
```bash
ruff check . 2>&1 | head -50
```

### Step 5: Post Review

Based on your findings, determine the appropriate review action:

- **Approve**: No critical or blocking issues found → use `--approve`
- **Request Changes**: Critical or blocking issues found → use `--request-changes`
- **Comment**: Informational only, no strong opinion either way → use `--comment`

Post the review using the appropriate flag:

```bash
# If approving:
gh pr review $ARGUMENTS --approve --body "YOUR_REVIEW_HERE"

# If requesting changes:
gh pr review $ARGUMENTS --request-changes --body "YOUR_REVIEW_HERE"

# If commenting only:
gh pr review $ARGUMENTS --comment --body "YOUR_REVIEW_HERE"
```

Use this format for the review:

```markdown
## Code & Security Review

### Critical Issues (if any)
[List blocking issues that must be fixed]

### Security Review
**Strengths:**
- [Positive security aspects]

**Concerns:**
- [Security issues found]

### Code Quality
- [Code quality issues]

### Summary Table
| Priority | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| Red | Must fix items |
| Yellow | Should fix items |
| Green | Consider items |

**Recommendation:** [Approve / Request Changes / Comment — with reasoning]
```

### Important Notes

- Be thorough but concise
- Prioritize security issues
- Include file:line references for specific issues
- Don't include sensitive information in the review
- If tests fail, note which ones and why
- Use `--approve` when the PR looks good (no red/blocking items)
- Use `--request-changes` when there are critical issues that must be fixed before merge
- Use `--comment` only when you have no strong recommendation either way
- All `gh` and `git` commands require `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`
